# SMAP_Millbrook_Data_Validation
The aim of this work was to create an app to help validate NASAâ€™s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite data in the region of Millbrook, NY

# Part 1: Data Processing
This part consisted of coding a python algorithm that converted numeric (csv file) in-situ Soil Moisture measurement data from different stations in Millbrook, NY to raster data. This part was essential because the SMAP data was in the format of raster data. Therefore, in order to compare the two datasets, the formats needed to be the same.

# Part 2: Application Development
This part conisted of developing an application on the Google Earth Engine platform that compared the two datasets. The application displays all the stations in Millbrook, NY from which the in-situ measurements were collected. The application displays a time series chart displaying both NASA's SMAP satellite data and the in-situ data depending on the station the user selects. Therefore, the user is able to visualize and compare the two different datasets over their desired station in Millbrook, NY.
